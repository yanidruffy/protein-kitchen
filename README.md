## Testing
## Deployment
The website was deployed using github pages using following method:
- Go to the "Settings" tab of your github repository
- Click on "Pages" on the left column
- Under "Source", select "main" branch
- Click on "Save" to deploy the website
- Once successfully deployed, a message with the live link will appear

### Committing Practices
At the start of this project, commits were written in past tense and were made infrequently and in larger batches. After learning about the best practices for commiting code, I made some changes. The messages are now in the imperative mood and commits are submitted more frequently and in smaller scales
