			<h3>Benefits of Protein Rich Foods</h3>
			<div id="muscle-weight">
				<h4>Muscle Growth and Repair <i class="fa-solid fa-dumbbell"></i></h4>
				<hr>
				<p>Protein is essential for building and repairing muscle tissue. When you consume protein-rich foods,
					your body uses the amino acids to create new muscle fibers. This process, known as muscle protein
					synthesis, is crucial for muscle growth and recovery after workouts.</p>
				<h4>Weight Management <i class="fa-solid fa-weight-scale"></i></i></h4>
				<hr>
				<p>Protein is highly satiating, meaning it helps you feel full for longer periods. This can lead to
					reduced calorie intake and weight management. High-protein diets have been shown to help people lose
					weight and maintain a healthy body weight.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="bone-skin">
				<h4>Improved Bone Health <i class="fa-solid fa-bone"></i></i></h4>
				<hr>
				<p>Protein plays a vital role in maintaining bone health. Adequate protein intake is associated with
					higher bone mineral density, which can reduce the risk of osteoporosis and fractures. Additionally,
					some studies suggest that protein may help slow down bone loss and improve bone strength.
				</p>
				<h4>Better Skin, Hair, and Nails <i class="fa-brands fa-envira"></i></h4>
				<hr>
				<p>Protein is a building block for many structures in the body, including skin, hair, and nails.
					Consuming enough protein can lead to healthier, stronger, and more vibrant hair, skin, and nails.
					Protein-rich foods also provide essential amino acids that support collagen production, which is
					crucial for skin elasticity and firmness.</p>
